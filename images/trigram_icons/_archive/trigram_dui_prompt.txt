Generate a flat design square icon (1:1 aspect ratio) for Trigram Dui (Lake) with "Dui" (兌) as the Concept and "Lake" (沢) as the Image.

REFERENCE IMAGES:
1. First image is the LAYOUT. Use this EXACTLY for the TEXT positioning and hierarchy.
   - "兌" (Dui): Representing Joy, Communication. Visual style: Bold, authoritative, strong.
   - "沢" (Lake): Representing the Image (Marsh, Reflection). Visual style: Ethereal, subordinate, expansive.

STYLE: Minimalist vector icon, NOT realistic. Flat design.
BACKGROUND: Solid Sky Blue (#87CEEB).

SUBJECT: The icon illustration should appear in the CENTER, integrated with the text.
- Symbol: A calm lake surface with bubbling joy or gentle ripples.
- Text Integration: The text "兌" (Top) and "沢" (Below it) are part of the design.
- Colors: Sky Blue background, Silver/White highlights, Soft Pink accents.

LAYOUT:
- Keep the layout from Image 1.
- Draw the illustration BEHIND or AROUND the text so the text remains legible.
- Trigram lines: Three lines at bottom (Solid, Solid, Broken) - Yellow/Gold.

IMPORTANT: Strictly enforce the Sky Blue background and the hierarchy of the text.
