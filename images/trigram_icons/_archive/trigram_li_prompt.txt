Generate a flat design square icon (1:1 aspect ratio) for Trigram Li (Fire) with "Li" (離) as the Concept and "Fire" (火) as the Image.

REFERENCE IMAGES:
1. First image is the LAYOUT. Use this EXACTLY for the TEXT positioning and hierarchy.
   - "離" (Li): Representing Clinging, Clarity, Intelligence. Visual style: Bold, authoritative, strong.
   - "火" (Fire): Representing the Image (Flame, Light). Visual style: Ethereal, subordinate, expansive.

STYLE: Minimalist vector icon, NOT realistic. Flat design.
BACKGROUND: Solid Vermilion/Red (#E34234).

SUBJECT: The icon illustration should appear in the CENTER, integrated with the text.
- Symbol: A stylized flame or an eye (symbolizing clarity).
- Text Integration: The text "離" (Top) and "火" (Below it) are part of the design.
- Colors: Vermilion background, Orange/Gold/White accents.

LAYOUT:
- Keep the layout from Image 1.
- Draw the illustration BEHIND or AROUND the text so the text remains legible.
- Trigram lines: Three lines at bottom (Solid, Broken, Solid) - Yellow/Gold.

IMPORTANT: Strictly enforce the Vermilion background and the hierarchy of the text.
