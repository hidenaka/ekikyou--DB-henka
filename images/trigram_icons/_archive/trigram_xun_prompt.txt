Generate a flat design square icon (1:1 aspect ratio) for Trigram Xun (Wind) with "Xun" (巽) as the Concept and "Wind" (風) as the Image.

REFERENCE IMAGES:
1. First image is the LAYOUT. Use this EXACTLY for the TEXT positioning and hierarchy.
   - "巽" (Xun): Representing Gentle, Penetrating. Visual style: Bold, authoritative, strong.
   - "風" (Wind): Representing the Image (Wood, Air). Visual style: Ethereal, subordinate, expansive.

STYLE: Minimalist vector icon, NOT realistic. Flat design.
BACKGROUND: Solid Emerald Green (#50C878).

SUBJECT: The icon illustration should appear in the CENTER, integrated with the text.
- Symbol: Flowing wind currents or a stylized tree bending.
- Text Integration: The text "巽" (Top) and "風" (Below it) are part of the design.
- Colors: Emerald Green background, White/Pale Green accents.

LAYOUT:
- Keep the layout from Image 1.
- Draw the illustration BEHIND or AROUND the text so the text remains legible.
- Trigram lines: Three lines at bottom (Broken, Solid, Solid) - Yellow/Gold.

IMPORTANT: Strictly enforce the Emerald Green background and the hierarchy of the text.
