Generate a flat design square icon (1:1 aspect ratio) for Trigram Kan (Water) with "Kan" (坎) as the Concept and "Water" (水) as the Image.

REFERENCE IMAGES:
1. First image is the LAYOUT. Use this EXACTLY for the TEXT positioning and hierarchy.
   - "坎" (Kan): Representing Danger, Wisdom, Depth. Visual style: Bold, authoritative, strong.
   - "水" (Water): Representing the Image (Abyss, Moon). Visual style: Ethereal, subordinate, expansive.

STYLE: Minimalist vector icon, NOT realistic. Flat design.
BACKGROUND: Solid Navy Blue (#000080).

SUBJECT: The icon illustration should appear in the CENTER, integrated with the text.
- Symbol: Deep flowing water, ripples, or a moon reflection.
- Text Integration: The text "坎" (Top) and "水" (Below it) are part of the design.
- Colors: Navy Blue background, Silver/White/Deep Blue accents.

LAYOUT:
- Keep the layout from Image 1.
- Draw the illustration BEHIND or AROUND the text so the text remains legible.
- Trigram lines: Three lines at bottom (Broken, Solid, Broken) - Yellow/Gold.

IMPORTANT: Strictly enforce the Navy Blue background and the hierarchy of the text.
