Generate a flat design square icon (1:1 aspect ratio) for Trigram Gen (Mountain) with "Gen" (艮) as the Concept and "Mountain" (山) as the Image.

REFERENCE IMAGES:
1. First image is the LAYOUT. Use this EXACTLY for the TEXT positioning and hierarchy.
   - "艮" (Gen): Representing Stillness, Stopping. Visual style: Bold, authoritative, strong.
   - "山" (Mountain): Representing the Image (Peak, Stability). Visual style: Ethereal, subordinate, expansive.

STYLE: Minimalist vector icon, NOT realistic. Flat design.
BACKGROUND: Solid Earth Brown (#8B4513).

SUBJECT: The icon illustration should appear in the CENTER, integrated with the text.
- Symbol: A stable mountain peak or heavy stone.
- Text Integration: The text "艮" (Top) and "山" (Below it) are part of the design.
- Colors: Earth Brown background, Terracotta/White accents.

LAYOUT:
- Keep the layout from Image 1.
- Draw the illustration BEHIND or AROUND the text so the text remains legible.
- Trigram lines: Three lines at bottom (Solid, Broken, Broken) - Yellow/Gold.

IMPORTANT: Strictly enforce the Earth Brown background and the hierarchy of the text.
