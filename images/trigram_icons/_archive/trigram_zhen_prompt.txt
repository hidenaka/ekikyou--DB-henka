Generate a flat design square icon (1:1 aspect ratio) for Trigram Zhen (Thunder) with "Zhen" (震) as the Concept and "Thunder" (雷) as the Image.

REFERENCE IMAGES:
1. First image is the LAYOUT. Use this EXACTLY for the TEXT positioning and hierarchy.
   - "震" (Zhen): Representing Arousing, Movement, Shock. Visual style: Bold, authoritative, strong.
   - "雷" (Thunder): Representing the Image (Lightning). Visual style: Ethereal, subordinate, expansive.

STYLE: Minimalist vector icon, NOT realistic. Flat design.
BACKGROUND: Solid Navy/Electric Blue (#000080).

SUBJECT: The icon illustration should appear in the CENTER, integrated with the text.
- Symbol: A dynamic lightning bolt or shockwave.
- Text Integration: The text "震" (Top) and "雷" (Below it) are part of the design.
- Colors: Navy background, Electric Yellow/Gold accents.

LAYOUT:
- Keep the layout from Image 1.
- Draw the illustration BEHIND or AROUND the text so the text remains legible.
- Trigram lines: Three lines at bottom (Broken, Broken, Solid) - Yellow/Gold.

IMPORTANT: Strictly enforce the Navy background and the hierarchy of the text.
