Generate a flat design square icon (1:1 aspect ratio) for Trigram Kun (Earth) with "Kun" (坤) as the Concept and "Earth" (地) as the Image.

REFERENCE IMAGES:
1. First image is the LAYOUT. Use this EXACTLY for the TEXT positioning and hierarchy.
   - "坤" (Kun): Representing Receptive, Nurturing. Visual style: Bold, authoritative, strong.
   - "地" (Earth): Representing the Image (Field, Soil). Visual style: Ethereal, subordinate, expansive.

STYLE: Minimalist vector icon, NOT realistic. Flat design.
BACKGROUND: Solid Terracotta/Ochre (#CD853F).

SUBJECT: The icon illustration should appear in the CENTER, integrated with the text.
- Symbol: Vast landscape, field, or nurturing soil.
- Text Integration: The text "坤" (Top) and "地" (Below it) are part of the design.
- Colors: Terracotta background, Wheat/Gold/Green accents.

LAYOUT:
- Keep the layout from Image 1.
- Draw the illustration BEHIND or AROUND the text so the text remains legible.
- Trigram lines: Three lines at bottom (Broken, Broken, Broken) - Yellow/Gold.

IMPORTANT: Strictly enforce the Terracotta background and the hierarchy of the text.
