Generate a flat design square icon (1:1 aspect ratio) for Trigram Qian (Heaven) with "Qian" (乾) as the Concept and "Heaven" (天) as the Image.

REFERENCE IMAGES:
1. First image is the LAYOUT. Use this EXACTLY for the TEXT positioning and hierarchy.
   - "乾" (Qian): Representing the Creative Principle (Energy, Action). Visual style: Bold, authoritative, strong.
   - "天" (Heaven): Representing the Celestial Image (Sky, Space). Visual style: Ethereal, subordinate, expansive.

STYLE: Minimalist vector icon, NOT realistic. Flat design.
BACKGROUND: Solid Deep Purple (#2D1B4E).

SUBJECT: The icon illustration (Sun/Sphere) should appear in the CENTER, integrated with the text.
- Symbol: A radiant, powerful golden sun. It represents the "Qian" energy manifested as "Heaven".
- Text Integration: The text "乾" (Top) and "天" (Below it) are part of the design. "Qian" is the title, "Heaven" is the attribute.
- Colors: Deep Purple background, Gold/White accents.

LAYOUT:
- Keep the layout from Image 1.
- Draw the illustration (Sun/Sphere) BEHIND or AROUND the text so the text remains legible.
- Trigram lines: Three solid lines at the bottom (Yellow/Gold).

IMPORTANT: Strictly enforce the Deep Purple background and the hierarchy of the text.
